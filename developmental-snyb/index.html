                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  Steve Nash Youth Basketball is a national youth basketball initiative designed to develop fundamental skills, sportsmanship and a love for the game of basketball. This grassroots program supports and empowers community-based recreational groups and facilities, schools and other institutions across Canada in an effort to positively influence youth through basketball. The goal of the program is to allow participants the opportunity to maximize their potential, while promoting the importance of youth basketball as a vehicle to build character, discipline and self-esteem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The model for Steve Nash Youth Basketball was established after extensive research of existing community basketball programs from across North America. It follows the guidelines of Sport Canadaâ€™s Long Term Athlete Development Model (LTAD). The program is flexible in nature to allow local organizers to adapt the program and implement it in their community while following its principles and philosophies, as well as gaining valuable support and materials to run a successful program.

                </p>
                <h2>Progression:</h2>

                <h2>LTAD Application</h2>
                <p>
                  The Canada Basketball Long Term Athlete Development (LTAD) model is based on the Canadian Sport for Life (CS4L) resource paper, which was developed by Canadian world leaders in the area of child and sport development. The model is an athlete centered, coach driven and administration, sport science, and partners supported program. It integrates elite, community, and scholastic sport, athletes with a disability, physical education and the general health of the nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Canada basketball and Steve Nash Youth Basketball fully adopts and endorses the concept of the LTAD as it provides the basis on which the future development of athletes is planned and implemented. The main principle behind Steve Nash Youth Basketball is built around the FUNdamentals and Learn to Train stages, as well as the 10 key factors of the LTAD, with the goal to ensure young athletes experience both optimal developments in basketball while maintaining lifelong retention in physical activity for improved wellness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Long Term Athlete Development is a progressive pathway of development that recognizes the distinct stages of physical, mental, cognitive, and emotional development in young athletes.
