                <h1>Former NMBA Lions Headed To ACAA Teams</h1>
              </div>
              <div class='text'>
                <p>The hard work, dedication and commitment to development and fundamentals is starting to pay off for the Northside Minor Basketball Association.</p>
                
                <p>Three former NMBA Lions are off to play at the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association level in 2014-15. Former Leo Hayes High Lions' Sara Ripley will play at Mount Allison University and her teammate Allison Keane will play with the Holland College Hurricanes of Charlottetown. Former NMBAer Emma Blizzard will be with the St. Thomas University Tommies. Blizzard played with the Fredericton High Black Kats.</p>
                
                <p>All three played at the bantam level with the NMBA during their minor basketball days.</p>
                
                <h2 id="sara-ripley">Sara Ripley</h2>
                
                <p>Ripley will be a welcome addition to the garnet and gold in Sackville with the Mounties, said head coach Matt Gamblin.The forward played for the 2New Brunswick Canada Summer Games team in Sherbrooke, Que., finishing off a stellar four-year career with the Lions.</p>
                
                <p>'Sara's work-ethic, and blue-chip approach to the game is well known throughout NB high school basketball,' said Gamblin. 'Her rebounding, defence and all-out hustle will translate great in our league and with our brand of basketball at MTA, we are very excited to have Sara joining the Mounties.'</p>
                
                <p>Ripley can't wait for the leaves to turn. 'After four years of high school basketball I'm really looking forward to taking my game to the next level,' she said. 'I am very excited to play for Mount A with some girls that I have played with before and with others I have yet to meet.'</p>
                
                <h2 id="allison-keane">Allison Keane</h2>
                
                <p>Keane, a 5'7'' guard is ready to suit up for the Hurricanes and will enter her first year in the Sport and Leisure Management Program this September.</p>
                
                <p>'I am so excited to be going into the Sport and Leisure Management Program at Holland College,' said Keane. 'I fell in love with the school and the City of Charlottetown while I was there for a tournament with my high school team.'</p>
                
                <p>The feeling is mutual with the 'Canes. 'Allison choosing Holland College as a student-athlete is a prime example of the importance of showcasing the college through the hosting of championships, tournaments and events to high-school recruits. We're very pleased to have her join us as a student-athlete,' said Albert Roche, Athletics and Recreation Director at Holland College.</p>
                
                <p>Keane was the captain of the Leo Hayes varsity basketball team in 2014 and a teammate with Ripley and Blizzard at the Canada Games. She also represented New Brunswick in 2012 on the under-16 provincial team.</p>
                
                <p>Hurricanes head coach Mike Connolly is pleased to have Keane join his roster after garnering attention from several local New Brunswick colleges and universities. 'She is a tough competitor who will bring a real energy on the defensive end,' he said. 'We think she is ready to make a contribution right away.</p>
                
                <p>Keane, who is working out with former teammates this summer, wants to bring pace to Holland College. 'I like a fast pace, up-tempo game and distributing the ball is my strength as well as shooting beyond the arc,' she said. 'Being gritty and aggressive on defence is what makes the game fun for me.'</p>
                
                <h2 id="emma-blizzard">Emma Blizzard</h2>
                
                <p>Fredericton basketball fans won't have to look too far to follow Blizzard as she joins perennial CCAA threat St. Thomas and head coach Fred Connors. Blizzard represented New Brunswick on the under-15 and under-17 provincial teams. She was a part of two New Brunswick Interscholastic Athletic Association champion teams.</p>
                
                <p>'We like Emma's toughness and defensive focus,' said Connors.  'She is a team-first player who wants to work hard and get better and is strong enough to handle the demands of the program.'</p>
