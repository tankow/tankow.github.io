                <h1>Lions Prepare for First Ever Eastern Canadian Trek</h1>
              </div>
              <div class='text'>
                <p><img alt="Bantam A Girls Division 1 Champs" src="../../../../../images/2014.nmba.d1.champs.jpg" /></p>
                
                <p>It seems like an awful long time ago. Mainly because it was.</p>
                
                <p>Just past three months to the day, the Northside Minor Basketball Association Lions captured the first Bantam Division 1 Girls' Championship, the team prepares for a major opportunity this week. The Lions became the first NMBA team to qualify for the Eastern Canadian Championship which unfolds at the Canada Games Centre in Halifax.</p>
                
                <p>Competition begins June 27, culminating with champions being crowned June 29. The tournament has girls and boys at the under-14 and under-13 divisions.</p>
                
                <p>The NMBA squad features 11 players, nine of them first year bantam players. Many had anticipated the Lions would challenge for an under-13 spot, but after winning the Basketball New Brunswick championship last March, away they go. 'It's been a long process from gearing our entire season toward that weekend in March,' said Lions' head coach Ryan Chase. 'What people perhaps didn't realize was everything we did from October up until championship weekend was to prepare for that Sunday. That was from practice to game selection to roster planning to about anything else you can imagine. The girls responded.'</p>
                
                <p>Following the championship, Chase gave the entire team almost six weeks off to pursue other sports and prepare for June. The team has played a number of exhibition games over the past month, but has only been together with a full complement of players once.</p>
                
                <p>That will change Friday.</p>
                
                <p>The Lions open against Newfoundland champion Square Up of St. John's on June 27 at 3:30 p.m. NMBA then faces Goulds of Newfoundland at 8 p.m. at the sparkling three-court facility. On June 28, there's a familiar foe as NMBA faces the Kennebecasis Valley Slammers at 11:30 a.m. at Mount St. Vincent's University. Depending on their record, the schedule will unfold for the Lions either later June 28 or into semifinals June 29. </p>
                
                <p>'It's going to be challenging where it's been so long, but the girls have retained what they've been taught all season,' said Chase, who is also head coach of the BNB under-15 boys' team preparing for nationals in late July. 'We have to ensure the girls don't get caught up in the excitement of playing at this level for the first time. Our mindset all year was 'it's just another game, just another team, just another challenge,' and that has to unfold again in Halifax. Our leaders need to lead, our scorers need to score and each and everyone of the players needs to defend.'</p>
                
                <p>Lauren Casey and Maegan Burtt are the two graduating players on the Lions' squad as they will say goodbye to the minor basketball system following the tournament, preparing to move into Leo Hayes High School in the fall. The Grade 7 players include Lucy Beaumont, Chantelle Austin, Torrie Janes, Jaiden Penney, Kali Wilson, Katie Morehouse, Abby Cartwright, Erin O'Shaughnessy and Erin Cunningham.</p>
                
                <p>You can follow results of the Lions on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/NMBALIONS">Twitter</a> and Facebook as the tournament unfolds.</p>
